\subsection{Safety}
industrial workplaces can be dangerous, wearables may contribute to safer environments. apps and mobile devices can help workers in hazardous environents by: sending notifications, visual recongition, and communication with machines. \cite{sda-wired}

example: jan 2012, one worker died when investigating noise in an oxygen furnance. pipe burst because of built-up pressure, causing death. the accident could have been avoided by utilizing ``smart devices'': machine sensors connected to smart-glasses or watches \(\rightarrow\) tell workers to stay away, pipe pressure data analysis \(\rightarrow\) investigation of possible cause without getting close\cite{sda-wired}

Greatest challenge is SW, not HW. SW must be intuitive to be used easily, SW must be connected to the IT and the devices. Improved data solutions for streamed machine data is also needed\cite{sda-wired}

Needed: policy and protocols for data governance, privacy, data administration of personal health-information, and extensive redcordings of mic and video feeds. All of these problems are related to SW. \cite{sda-wired}
