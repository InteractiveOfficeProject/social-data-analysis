\paragraph{Collaboration}
major factor in office design: supporting different styles of work. collaborative work needs places where ``the atmosphere is
conducive to innovation'', i.e. not as boring as a normal meeting room. however, there must also be place to receive phone calls and to work concentrated on a project etc., i.e. silent working areas are needed.\cite[tieto]

If these areas are provided, the employees must be able to freely move between these areas. therefore the office must provide an``instant, real-time picture of what's going on'' so that the people see where space is available. It is also crucial that the office provides a way to see where colleagues are working as they are able to freely move between different areas. \cite[tieto]

Example of working together: spontaneous meetings, just see who'S around, where's room and go. \cite[tieto]
