\subsection{Efficiency}
Tracking Room usage via sensors, connect to outlook etc\(\rightarrow\) Dynamic room booking, usage trends. \(\Rightarrow\) less distractions, more focus on satisftaction and efficiency\cite{iotagenda}

Don't measure productivity by time spent at work place or at desk. MEasure actual work output. Fun and exciting workplaces lead to more creative employees and more comraderie between employees. This in turn leads to a more successful business. 
\cite{roomzilla3}

biggest issue in many companies: problems with presentations during meetings. problems: tangled wires, used but unbooked rooms, failing connections to the devices. Streamlined processes improve usability and efficiency, improved meetings rooms (wireless, better booking, LM booking) also lead to better and more efficient meetings, incl .scheduling meetings. \cite{roomzilla3}

LEarning systems can help the company to save time and energy\\
e.g. smart call system with automated menu learns to automatically direct calls to the correct department or person\(\rightarrow\) less time wsted on redirection. e.g. worker has problem with (potentially internal) application, AI system detects application and routes the support call to correct IT team\\
remote support is possible via audio and video conferences, pc management via remote access. still in infant stage but great potential \cite{hbcommunications}

streamlining communication and improving connectivity leads to better and faster collaboration. connecting to the ``right guy'' gets easier \cite{hbcommunications}
